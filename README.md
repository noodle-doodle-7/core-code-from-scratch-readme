Compiled vrs Interpreted programming languages

- Compiled Languages

These are instructions that our processor can handle and understand, and have to be manually compiled. These are faster and efficent to handle and provide better control over hardware. 

      - there are 3 parts for these code:
            - source code
            - compiler
            - machine code (executable)

- Interpreted Languages

These are processed on a line-by-line format, this makes them slower than compiled languages but they're some simpler to code. Also this types of languages can be changed on-the-go and display real-time changes as well.

      - this code is not compiled, that means that everybody will need a interpreter to execute the code.
