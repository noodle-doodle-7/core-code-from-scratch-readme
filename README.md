## Compiled vs Interpreted programming languages

### Compiled Languages

These are instructions that our processor can handle and understand, and have to be manually compiled. These are faster and efficent to handle and provide better control over hardware. 

> there are 3 parts for these code: source code, compiler & machine code (executable).
            
| Pros ✅ | Cons ❌ |
| ---- | ---- |
| Ready to run | Not cross-platform |
| Open faster | Not flexible |
| Source Code stays private/secured | Too much steps |

### Interpreted Languages

These are processed on a line-by-line format, this makes them slower than compiled languages but they're some simpler to code. Also this types of languages can be changed on-the-go and display real-time changes as well.

> this code is not compiled, that means that everybody will need a interpreter to execute the code.

| Pros ✅ | Cons ❌ |
| ---- | ---- |
| Cross-platform | Interpreter required |
| Simpler to test | Ofter Slower |
| Easier to debug | Source Code is public |

## Pseudocode currency converter

```
### num1 = USD amount to covert
### num2 = updated BTC value
### Total = USD amount coverted to BTC

START
num1 <-- GET
num2 <-- GET(https://valuta.exchange/es/usd-to-btc)
Total <-- num1 / num2
PRINT Total
END
```

## Low-Level vs High-Level Programming Languages

The level of a coding languages represents the amount of abstraction between *Programming Languages* and *Machine Languages*

| Low-Level | High-Level |
